step2.identify duplicated gene sets 

download the duplicated genes with shared origin in legume family, mainly the file 

legume.fam3.VLMQ.sup1A_hsh.tsv
#this file listed each gene family and the gene id across all legume species 
#filter the gene family that only contains four duplicated genes from soybean - glyma 
#filter further to focus on the duplicated genes specifically evolve from whole genome duplication (all of the four genes)

legume.fam3.VLMQ.sup1B_trees
#this folder contains all the trees, each for one gene family 
#use the customized script to filter the trees that contain two clades exclusively including two duplicated genes from soybean and extracted the gene ID from two clades 

intersect the two above steps to focus on the four duplicated genes that originate from the ancestor of all legume species 

The tree information combined with the duplicated genes with their associated duplicate mechanisms also us to distinguish the WGD genes, derived from the second or first rounds of WGD.
Two out of the six WGD duplicated pairs with the closest relationships.
