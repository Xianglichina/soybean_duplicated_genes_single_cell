step2.identify duplicated gene sets 

download the files with the information of duplicated genes with shared origin within legume family (from soybase)

legume.fam3.VLMQ.sup1A_hsh.tsv
#this file listed each gene family and the gene ids across all legume species 
#filter the gene family that only contains four duplicated genes from soybean - glyma 
#filter further to focus on the duplicated genes specifically evolve from whole genome duplication (all of the four genes)

legume.fam3.VLMQ.sup1B_trees
#this folder contains all the trees, each for one gene family 
#use the customized script to filter the trees that contain two clades exclusively including two duplicated genes from soybean and extracted the gene ID from two clades 

notes:
#focus on the four WGD duplicated genes that originate from the same ancestor of all legume species 
# use tree information to distinguish the WGD duplicated genes, derived from the second or first round of WGD.
