# soybean_duplicated_genes_single_cell
Gene duplication is a major source of evolutionary innovation, enabling the emergence of novel expression patterns and functions. However, previous studies have primarily assessed expression divergence at the tissue level, often relying solely on differential expression as a metric. Leveraging single-cell genomics, we investigated the transcriptional dynamics and cis-regulatory evolution of duplicated genes in cultivated soybean (Glycine max), that has undergone two rounds of whole-genome duplication. Our analysis revealed extensive transcriptional divergence among these duplicated gene pairs both within and across tissues. These expression divergences are correlated with both sequence variation and the presence or absence of their associated accessible chromatin regions (ACRs), where cis-regulatory elements (CREs) reside.
